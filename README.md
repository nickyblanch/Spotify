# spotify_player.py
This script implements the app functionality. In order to run, the user must have the most recent (2.16.1) version of Spotipy installed in their Python 3 environment.

# spotify_graphics.py
This script implements the GUI. This displays the current song name, artist, and album.

# graphics.py
This is a graphics module that I used to create the GUI. It is a slightly modified version of the Tkinter package. Credit for compiling this package goes to Benjamin Dicken at benjdd.com.

# IMPORTANT
Before either program will work, the user must enter their own client ID, client secret, and Spotify username into the appropriate areas in the 'setup()' function in both the spotify_player.py and spotify_graphics.py documents. For security reasons, I omitted my own ID, secret, and username.
